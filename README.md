# Portfolio

Hello visitor. I'm happy that you are checking out my portfolio. This is the code to it and I wasn't entierly sure if I wanted to show it to you.

I see this project as my playground and I am not very eager to write the driest cleanest and most tested code here. Here I want to have fun and try out new libraries and services.

So if you are checking out my skills please have a look at the projects in my portfolio. You will find them in the projects section of the deployed portfolio. There you will find clean and dry code.

In this portfolio I use: Next.js, three.js, r3f, SendGrid, Framer Motion, Tailwind, Prettier, Contentful etc...

Here you can visit my portfolio: [sandragufler.se](https://www.sandragufler.se/)

Thank you very much for your interest in my portfolio!

Kind regards,
Sandra
